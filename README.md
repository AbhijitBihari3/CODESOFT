Simple Rule-Based Chatbot
This project demonstrates a simple rule-based chatbot implemented in Python. The chatbot uses basic if-else statements to respond to user inputs based on predefined rules. It's designed to provide a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

Features:
1- Responds to greetings and common questions.
2- Handles unknown inputs gracefully.
3- Simple and easy-to-understand code structure.

Getting Started:
-Clone the repository.
-Run the chatbot script: python chatbot.py
-Interact with the chatbot in the terminal.

Feel free to extend and improve the chatbot by adding more sophisticated NLP techniques and conversation patterns!
